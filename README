Build debian packages for network booting of tills

These packages are installed on a server (usually, but not
necessarily, the main till).

You must be (real) root when running the build scripts.

Required packages:
debootstrap squashfs-tools systemd-container qemu-user-static binfmt-support wget parallel


Terms used:

"platform": the type of computer to be booted.  Platforms vary in
their requirements for boot files and their placement: for example,
the 'pc' platform uses ipxe, boot-time config is placed into
'hostname.ipxe' files, and the DHCP server points the client at the
appropriate file.  The 'rpi' platform uses the PI's own network
bootloader; boot-time config and supporting files are placed into a
subdirectory named according to the serial number of the PI to be
booted.

Current platforms are 'pc' and 'rpi'.

"distribution": the codename of the debian-derived operating system,
eg. 'xenial', 'bionic', 'focal' for Ubuntu, 'buster' for debian or
raspberry pi os
