We seem to have more luck running as real-root than fakeroot.

build-squashfs is just for testing.  Use build-deb to make the real
package.

Packages to install on the machine doing the building:

debootstrap squashfs-tools systemd-container pxelinux syslinux-common grub-efi-amd64-signed shim-signed grub-common
