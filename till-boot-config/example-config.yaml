# This file should usually be called /etc/till-boot/config

# The configuration generator assumes that there is a DHCP server set up
# with the following in its configuration file:

# option arch code 93 = unsigned integer 16;
# [...]
# group {
#   if exists user-class and option user-class = "iPXE" {
#     filename = concat (host-decl-name, ".ipxe");
#   } elsif option arch = 00:07 {
#     filename "ipxe.efi";
#   } else {
#     filename "ipxe.pxe";
#   }
#
#   next-server [the tftp server];
#
# [and then for every network booted till...]
#   host test-till {
#     hardware ethernet 08:00:27:db:57:9a;
#     fixed-address test-till;
#   }
#
# }

# Configuration files will be generated for each network booted till
# and made available on the TFTP server as [till-name].ipxe - so,
# test-till.ipxe for the example above.

# Location served by tftpd: we put config files here
tftp-dir: /var/lib/tftpboot

# Versions are treated as integers; higher numbers are more recent
nfs-dir: /usr/share/till-boot

# Location of kernels and initrds extracted from squashfs
# We expect subdirectories to be named distribution/arch/version
# and within those, kernels to be named vmlinuz and initrds initrd.img
